            <p>The biggest part of PBBGs are text-based. This means that there is little to no graphics, with the
                emphasis being on the text part. Their genres are pretty varied, ranging from fantasy to mob games.</p>

            <p>Fallen London (formerly Echo Bazaar) is a browser game produced by Failbetter Games. It's set in the
                eponymous city, a mile underground and a boat down the river from Hell, where people are either piecing
                together the mystery of what exactly happened, trading souls, or just politely murdering other people.
                Players start off as prisoners plotting to break out, and after that... they're free to do whatever they
                want.</p>

            <p>Kingdom of Loathing (KoL) is a humorous, browser-based, multiplayer role playing game. It is notable for
                its use of hand-drawn stick figure graphics and writing characterized by surreal humor, word play,
                parody and references to pop culture. In KoL, players fight monsters for experience, meat (the game's
                currency), and items, through a turn-based system. Players also interact with each other through player
                versus player competition, participate in the in-game economy by trading goods and services, and
                organize themselves into clans, and speak to each other in many different chat channels.</p>
