            <h1>Virtual pet sites</h1>
            <p>Virtual pets have been popular ever since the 90s, so it's no surprise that there are several virtual pet
                browser games that survived over the years as well as a couple of newer ones.</p>

        <h2>Here are some the best:</h2>

            <img src="img/flight-rising.png" alt="Flight Rising">
            <p>Active since: 2013</p>
            <p>Flight Rising is a social web-based activity site featuring dragon breeding, adventuring (a planned
                feature not yet implemented), combat, and collecting. It puts you in control of your own clan of
                dragons, allowing you to breed them in varying colors and patterns, specialize their abilities and
                stats, and adorn them thousands of different ways with a variety of apparel and skins.</p>

            <p>Active since: 2020</p>
            <p>Dappervolk is a cute online pet and avatar game with a painterly style and RPG elements. Dropped into the
                game as a "worldhopper" with no memory of who you are - but with curious pet animation powers - you will
                embark upon a quest to discover the truth regarding your origins and those of the magical world around
                you. You can collect tons of unique items to customize your character with, collect adorable pets, go
                adventuring and solve hundreds of riddles, play minigames, do quests and more! Game is also meant to be
                highly social, with quests requiring social interactions and with there being no easy way of getting
                certain items without trading.</p>

            <img src="img/neopets.webp" alt="Neopets">
            <p>Active since: 1999</p>
            <p>First launched in 1999, Neopets was once the biggest digital pet game in existence. Players could buy,
                win, trade, collect, and customize a wide variety of colorful cartoon animals. Mini-games, events,
                forums, and an ever-shifting economy kept gameplay interesting for years. It's since become a major
                point of nostalgia for many a millennial, with former players fondly remembering their long-lost pets
                and the site's charming, quintessentially Y2K aesthetic.</p>
