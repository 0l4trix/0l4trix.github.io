            <h2>What are PBBG's?</h2>
            <p>PBBG stands for a Persistent Browser Based Game which means that they are games that are entirely
                contained within a website which can be played directly from your browser without the need to download
                any software or game engines. They may sometimes be referred to as a MPBBG (Multiplayer Persistant
                Browser Based Game); however, since a multiplayer environment is already assumed with a PBBG this is
                rarely seen. These should not be confused with your basic games such as Bejeweled, pool, or other basic
                types of games that you can play online; the key difference is in the “persistent” nature of the game.
                The PBBG Project defines this as a requirement for a PBBG when “progress in the game is achieved over
                multiple playing sessions.”</p>
            <p>With a PBBG you build a character, village, world, etc. over time and the game grows and changes in
                dynamics as you advance. Often, certain elements of game play may also continue over real time and /or
                while you are offline and not actually logged into the game. For example, one way to earn gold in
                Monsters Game (a vampire verses werewolf PBBG) is to work in the graveyard for a number of hours. You
                choose to work for eight hours, go to bed, and when you wake up your shift will have ended and you can
                collect your pay.</p>

            <h2>What is the difference between a PBBG and MMORPG?</h2>
            <p>While there are some elements that overlap between a PBBG and a MMORPG the main difference is that the
                PBBG is run from a website that loads in your browser and does not rely on any other software that the
                player has to download. Because of this the PBBG is often not as graphically intense and relies on 2d
                game graphics. It may often offer more plot driven play that can be a lot of fun for both newcomers and
                seasoned players alike.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="vs.textbased">
            <h2>What is the difference between PBBG's and text based RPG's?</h2>
            <p>There is a tremendous amount of over lap between PBBG's and the traditional text base RPG's. However,
                there are some games in which there is very little in the way of role playing and the game focuses
                mainly on the mechanics of the game engine itself. This variety allows you to choose which type of
                gaming environment you enjoy most.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="types">
            <h2>What type of PBBG's are out there?</h2>
            <p>PBBG's come in just about every genre that you can think of from vampire worlds, space battles, pirates,
                fantasy themed, samurai wars, to nation building and political simulation games.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="gameplay">
            <h2>What is the gameplay like in a PBBG?</h2>
            <ul>Gameplay in a PBBG can vary somewhat from game to game but will generally incorporate some or all of
                the following elements:
                <li>Hunts or Searches: Many game engines in the PBBG categories will generate some sort of a search or
                    hunt function in which you go on searches through various areas in the game world to find items,
                    collect money, or other elements that you will need to play the game. You are often granted a
                    certain number of searches or hunts per day.</li>
                <li>Battles Against NPC's: Most PBBG's will have a battle system that randomly pits you against an NPC
                    (Non-Playable Character) to strengthen your skills or gain resources.</li>
                <li>PVP Battles: Another feature of many PBBG's is a dice role type battle system that allows you to
                    attack other players and battle to win resources or experience and strengthen your stats.</li>
                <li>Banking System and Economy: Whether it is collecting gold or some other world specific currency,
                    most PBBG games will have some sort of an internal economy and a banking system that allows you to
                    earn money and purchase items that you will need for the game.</li>
                <li>Clans/Guilds/Covens: Another common feature of PBBG's is a clan or guild system which helps you to
                    meet other players and advance game play by working on a team and forming alliances against your
                    enemies.</li>
                <li>Since every game can be unique there may be several other features such as quests, group missions,
                    homes or world building, etc. so you will have lots to explore and do in a PBBG.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="advantages">
            <h2>What are the advantages of playing a PBBG?</h2>
            <p>PBBG's actually have quite a few advantages over some of the other styles of games available online. For
                one, because they can be played entirely from your browser there is no need to download any software.
                This leaves more of your hard drive space free, plus it gives you a chance to play from anywhere that
                you have an internet connection. Since most PBBG's rely on a standard script language such as php, you
                can
                even access some of them from mobile browsers on your phone or PDA. This allows you to get your gaming
                fix from just about anywhere.</p>
            <p>While some PBBG's offer special items or extra benefits for supporting the game, most of them are free to
                play.</p>
            <p>PBBG's can often be enjoyed by both the average gamer and the more hardcore types since they do not
                require you to be present 24/7 to make progress on your character.</p>
            <p>PBBG's offer a unique blend of creative control and pre-scripted game engine play so you never get bored
                doing the same thing over and over again.</p>

        <section id="disappearance">
            <h2>Why did they start disappearing?</h2>
            <p>PBBGs had brought accessibility to the table, but accessibility evolved in a big way with the launch of
                iPhone's App Store in 2008. While Apple didn't invent mobile gaming - mobile games existed in the
                mid-90s - they did launch it into a new era, and in doing so they changed one of the most critical
                aspects of digital gaming: where people play. PBBGs, and browser-based games in general, now had viable
                competition for “play anywhere” experiences, with mobile offering even more options. Playing at school
                and work was old news; you could now play games on the bus, on your lunch break or even on the toilet.
            </p>
            <p>While many PBBGs still technically worked in a mobile web browser, the experiences often paled in
                comparison to native mobile apps, and many games simply looked horrible on mobile because they were
                never designed for that viewing experience. Playing a game in the browser, once a liberating experience
                to play anywhere, had become a glaringly restrictive experience as the definition of “anywhere” changed
                and the experience failed to translate. Sadly, the strength of being built for a web browser had become
                a weakness.</p>
            <p>Although web technology did eventually catch up, with mobile-friendly responsive designs becoming more
                common in the early 2010s thanks to Media Queries, most PBBGs failed to adapt. Many still haven't caught
                up, which is evident by the number of games that still lack a mobile-friendly web design, let alone an
                actual mobile app.</p>

        <section id="players">
            <h2>How many people still play PBBGs?</h2>
            <p>While PBBGs are admittedly past their prime, their are still quite a few people who enjoy playing them.
                Most of these games tend to have a few hundred players online at the same time at best, however there
                are a few that even go into the thousands.</p>
