            <h1>After the bombing</h1>
            <p>Probably everyone knows the tragic story of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In early August 1945, the United
                States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, devastating these two cities. More than 100,000 people ended
                up dying either from direct exposure or the long-term side effects of radiation such as leukemia or
                cancer.</p>

                places they had been, serving as a reminder of the human ability to regenrate. Here's how the bomb sites
                of these two cities look today.</p>
