                <p>You continue quietly sneaking away from the dragon and that's when you notice it in the distance. The
                    silhouette of a village! You probably could have noticed it earlier but because of the dragon and
                    chest you were a bit too occupied. You <s>won</s> did it! Congrats! (It's a shame you didn't
                    get to open the chest though)</p>

                <p>You find a glistening treasure chest!</p>

                <button class="thirdPhaseTriggerB">Just leave</button>
                <p class="thirdPhaseA">You open the chest and find... a gorgeous but deadly-looking sword! Who puts a
                    weapon in a treasure chest? You take it out but not a moment sooner do you see a huge shadow falling
                    over you. Looks like the opening of the chest woke the dragon up. It shreds you to pieces so fast
                    you don't even get to think of defending yourself with your newfound weapon.</p>
                <p class="thirdPhaseB">You continue on. Though the only way forward is to the south-west because south
                    from here the rocky surface seems to disappear in favour of the deep water.<button
