    <h1>Less popular genres</h1>
    <p>While most PBBGs are either text-based or virtual pet sites, there are also some other genres of them out
    there. MMORPGs are common, though those not text-based are somewhat more rare. There are several idle
    games and some more unique PBBGs available as well.</p>

    <img src="img/sengoku.png" alt="Sengoku Yokai" height="70%" width="70%">
    <p>Active since: 2023</p>
    <p>Innovative RPG that takes inspiration from Japanese folklore and mythology, allowing players to choose
    their class from a variety of Yokai creatures with unique abilities. This game rewards active players,
    because there is no really any content that you can do while afk. It has a real time combat, where you
    can even party up with you friends and do the dungeons together. No energy, some cooldowns and limits
    here and there, but besides that, you can enjoy the game all day. Progression in Sengoku: Y≈çkai is a bit
    different than other PBBGs in that it's primarily focused on reincarnations, gearing up and leveling up
    you skills that you have inherited by making a pack with a Yokai. A LOT of customization.</p>
